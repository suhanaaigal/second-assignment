## Making Pull Requests

We follow the GitHub pull request model for accepting contributions. Hereâ€™s how you can submit a PR:

1. **Create a New Branch**: Always work on a new branch. Create a branch based on the issue you're working on, for example:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix/issue-123
    ```

2. **Commit Your Changes**: Write clear, concise commit messages. A good commit message format looks like:

    ```
    # Example commit message
    Fix: resolve issue with page not loading (#123)
    ```

3. **Push the Branch**:

    ```bash
    git push origin fix/issue-123
    ```

4. **Open a Pull Request**: Go to your forked repository on GitHub, and you'll see a button to create a pull request.

5. **Description**: In the pull request description, please include:
    - A summary of what youâ€™ve changed or added.
    - A reference to the issue youâ€™re addressing (if applicable).
    - Any additional details that will help in the review process.

6. **Wait for Review**: A project maintainer will review your pull request and may ask for changes or clarification.

## Development Guidelines

When contributing code, please follow these guidelines:

- Keep pull requests small and focused on one issue.
- Make sure the code is properly tested.
- Write clear comments to explain complex parts of your code.
- Make sure all tests pass before submitting your PR.
